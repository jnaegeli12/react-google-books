## Installation
Use `npm i` to install the dependencies.
## Usage
On the Search page, enter a title or a keyword from a title of a book, and 10 titles will appear on submit. Each entry includes a link to find more details on Google, as well as a button to add the chosen book to a Favorites list. View the favorites by clicking the Favorites link in the top left corner. Favorite books are rendered on the same results card as the search, and they include a button to remove the chosen book from the list.
